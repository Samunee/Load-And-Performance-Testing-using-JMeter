### Load Testing

Load testing is the process of checking the behavior of the system under test under the anticipated load. For example, the piece of software under test is designed to serve X users (because it is an internal product of an enterprise and there are no more employees), so it does not make sense to conduct testing under a higher load. Therefore, it is sufficient to check if the performance is good enough and matches non-functional requirements or service level agreements. 

### Performance Testing

Performance testing is a testing method that evaluates how the system behaves and performs. Software performance testing examines responsiveness, stability, scalability, reliability, speed, and resource usage of your software and infrastructure.
